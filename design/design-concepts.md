#Design Concepts

A written description of your approach to the redesign that outlines:
- Your overall concept and/or theme
- How you hope to impact/affect the user
- Links to inspirational designs you have looked at


In the process of approaching and concepting this redesign, I have pulled from several sources. These include, but are not limited to, 
module required readings from the Web Style Guide that denote researched, prime, page layout according to user expectations, other Zen Garden
redesigns that I liked, and other themed websites in general. 

For my redesign, I have chosen to go with a simplistic/chunky, centered, one page scrolling website. I did this because I like content being unified
and leading from one piece of content to the other in a downfalling fashion. This also works well with how readers usually scan pages, left to right, 
and top to bottom. A Z-pattern. The only section I didn't center, but set to the left hand/top side, was the resources sidebar. I did this to 
be in accord with the proven "F" pattern that users scan pages, to make sure that it doesn't get overlooked, and viewers know that those options are 
available to them. The reason I didn't do this with the other sidebar was because I wanted the emphasis to be on the page's main content/afford
the viewers, and myself, the opportunity to enjoy my design. "Other designs" are introduced once the main content has been worked through and, logically,
readers start getting curious about other redesigns people have made. 
For my theme, as of now, I believe I will go with an African Serengeti type theme. With images that complement their sections. I want this to be simplistic,
yet full of character. 

I hope that the user feels a refreshing/satfisfying feeling when viewing my redesign. I hope to accomplish this through a simplistic, easy to read design 
that also has a theme that gives the page some character. After the viewer goes through my page, I hope that they leave feeling that nothing was lacking,
it wasn't too long, and that it had it's own identity.
